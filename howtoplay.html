     <li>Each player is given a set of ten cards. Each card has four categories relating to ships, with a unique set of responses.</li>
     <br>
     <li >The first player starts by selecting a category from the top card in their deck.</li>
     <br>
     <li >The second player then compares the same category on their own card, and whichever player's card has the highest number relating to the chosen category wins the round. 
     This player then takes both top cards.</li>
     <br>
     <li>The players then take the next card in their decks, and the second player now choses the category.</li>
     <br>
     <li>The game continues until one player has all twenty cards, the first player to reach twenty wins.</li>
