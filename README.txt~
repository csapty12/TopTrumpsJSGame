to start the program from the very begining, please go to the welcome.html page to be loaded up first. then from there you can access any of the other pages and modes within the game.
if this page does not have loadable buttons or the links dont work due to compatability issues on your OS/browser, in that case, please go firectly to "card.html" where single player mode will be started
and that you can access other parts of the website using the tool bar links
